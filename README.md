## Earlier steps:
Calibration of pi camera.\
Get the image from camera and get the undistorted region of interest.


## Base architecture of the model:
The bot will follow the path with detecting yellow line on it's left and white line on it's right in particular.\
The bot will follow the mean path between these two detected lines.\
Even if it detects any one line with it's signified color the bot will behave normal.\

## Challenges:
If the yellow line is detected as white line due to poor lightning conditions the bot will face problem while taking a turn.
