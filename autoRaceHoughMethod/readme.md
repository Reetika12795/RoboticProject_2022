# Autorace Houghtransform Method

This is not a properly working code!!

The approach for this method is to detect the lanes and move the bot along the lane. The problem occurred during the turns. Curve detection is the threshold for this method to work.

To run the code only in straight lane, change the subscribed topic to get image from desired source in 'detect_lanes.py' file.

run - 

```
python3 detect_lanes.py
```
